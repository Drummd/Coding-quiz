# Coding-quiz

Began with a simple structure of the html with designations of simple elements to form in java script
then began javascript with simple loop function of variables for 1 question at a time
then decided on a true of false system for 0 being false and 1 being true
using this i began a function that read the array of each looped answer to the corresponding question
click events are added to start the function and a timer was used with the click as well
timers were giving trouble due to time starting before the click event
once that problem was fixed all the questions were written with the answers
css was started with a structured flexbox and a simple color pallete
the questions and answers were put center with the title in the corner
a button was made but not working prior to the css part and was properly activated to show it as a button using the hover system
